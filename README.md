# Nest 0.1
 New version of Nest Application

A personal project resembling a social network and crafted using Django. Within this endeavor, I meticulously designed and executed a Django-based web application, mirroring functionalities found on Discord. The result was a resilient platform featuring comprehensive CRUD capabilities, allowing users to seamlessly manage nests by creating, editing, and deleting them. In addition to these features, I integrated a chat function to facilitate user communication within each nest. As part of ongoing improvements, I am actively involved in the development of a RESTful API using Django REST framework, with the aim of further enhancing user interactions on the platform.
