Title: A Ray of Hope: Saheb's Journey to Education

[Scene 1: Saheb's Life at the Construction Site]

(Saheb, a young boy with a determined look on his face, stands amidst the hustle and bustle of a construction site. He
wears tattered clothes, and his hands bear the marks of hard labor.)

Saheb (Narrating, solemnly): Life at the construction site was unrelenting. I was just a boy, but I had to carry bricks,
fetch water, and endure the harsh sun to make ends meet.

[Scene 2: Discovery of a Mysterious Book]

(Saheb spots a partially buried book, its pages weathered and dusty, amid the rubble. His eyes light up with curiosity
as he carefully retrieves it.)

Saheb (Excitedly, to himself): What's this? A book? In a place like this? Maybe it's my chance to learn something new.

[Scene 3: A Curious Meeting]

(Ayush, a well-dressed schoolboy, approaches Saheb with a mix of curiosity and suspicion.)

Ayush (Curious): Hey, who are you? What are you doing here?

Saheb (Nervous): Um, I found this book, and I wanted to know what's inside.

Ayush (Friendly, offering a hand): Well, I'm Ayush. Let's read it together. It's much more fun that way!

[Scene 4: A Bond of Friendship]

(Ayush and Saheb sit under a tree, engrossed in the book. Their faces light up with smiles as they discuss the stories
they've just read.)

Ayush (Enthusiastic): Saheb, I brought another book for us today! It's a fantastic adventure story.

Saheb (Grateful): Thank you, Ayush. These stories are like magic. They take me to places I've never been.

[Scene 5: The Disappearance]

(Ayush searches for Saheb, visiting the construction site and discreetly observing the harsh working conditions and
Saheb's absence.)

Ayush (Worried, looking around): Saheb hasn't shown up for days. I have to find him, no matter what.

[Scene 6: The Brutal Reality]

(Saheb, with a bruise on his arm, tries to hide the pain from Ayush, who confronts him.)

Saheb (Bruised, whispering): Ayush, I can't leave this job. The contractor beat me when I did, and I'm scared of losing
it.

Ayush (Sympathetic, placing a comforting hand on Saheb's shoulder): We'll find a way, Saheb. You don't have to go
through this alone. I promise.

[Scene 7: A Teacher's Wisdom]

(Teacher approaches Ayush, noticing his despondency as he sits alone on a bench while other children play.)

Teacher (Caring): Ayush, what's troubling you? Why aren't you playing with your friends?

Ayush (Sad): It's Saheb, sir. He's back at the construction site, and I don't know what to do. He deserves a chance to
learn, just like me.

[Scene 8: A Lesson in Rights]

(Teacher takes Ayush aside and imparts a valuable lesson about the importance of education and the illegality of child
labor.)

Teacher (Serious): Saheb, you have the right to education. Child labor is illegal, and you deserve a chance to learn,
grow, and dream.

[Scene 9: A Ray of Hope]

(With determination, Ayush and the teacher dial the child helpline number, 1098.)

Child Helpline Operator (Reassuring): Don't worry, we'll take care of this. The contractor will face the consequences,
and Saheb will get the education he deserves. We're here to help.

[Scene 10: A Bright Future]

(Saheb, in a school uniform, stands outside the school gate, his face radiant with hope. Ayush, beside him, shares his
excitement.)

Saheb (Excited): Ayush, I can't believe it! I'm going to school!

Ayush (Smiling): We're going to have so much fun learning together, Saheb. Your journey to a brighter future starts now.
